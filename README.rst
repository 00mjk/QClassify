Description
===========

QClassify is a Python framework for implementing variational quantum classifiers. The goal is to provide a generally customizable way of performing classification tasks using gate-model quantum devices. The quantum devices can be either simulated by a quantum simulator or a cloud-based quantum processor accessible via Rigetti Computing's `Quantum Cloud Services <https://www.rigetti.com/qcs>`__.

Variational quantum classification is a paradigm of supervised quantum machine learning that has been investigated actively in the quantum computing community (See for instance `Farhi and Neven <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06002>`__, `Schuld et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633>`__, `Mitarai et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00745>`__ and `Havlicek et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326>`__). 

Features
--------

The implementation allows for modular design of the following components of a variational classifier: 

1. *Encoder*: transforms a classical data vector into a quantum state.
	1.1 *Classical preprocessor*: maps an input data vector to circuit parameters.
	1.2 *Quantum state preparation*: applies the parametrized circuit to an all-zero input state to generate a quantum state encoding the input data.
    
2. *Processor*: extracts information from the encoded quantum state.
	2.1 *Quantum state transformation*: applies a parametrized circuit to the encoded quantum state to transform it into a form more amenable for information extraction by measurement and classical postprocessing.
	2.2 *Information extraction*: extract classical information from the output quantum state
		2.2.1 *Measurement*: repeatedly run the quantum circuit, perform measurements and collect measurement statistics
		2.2.2 *Classical postprocessing*: glean information from the measurement statistics and produce the output label of the quantum classifier.

Installation
============

To install QCompress using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install qclassify

Try executing ``import qclassify`` to test the installation in your terminal.


To instead install QCompress from source, clone this repository, ``cd`` into it, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/hsim13372/QCompress
	cd QClassify
	python -m pip install -e .

Note that the pyQuil version used requires Python 3.6 or later. For installation on a user QMI, please click `here <https://github.com/hsim13372/QCompress/blob/master/qmi_instructions.rst>`__.


Examples
========

We provide a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the utility of QClassify. 

.. csv-table::
